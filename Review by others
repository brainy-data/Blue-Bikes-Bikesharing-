Interpretation on coefficients: First of all, AR(p) and MA(q) terms are bounded between (−1,1) or else the process is not stationary. 
Second, you judge whether a coefficient is statistically significant based on the relevant t−test. 
For example your third exogenous variable, while large on absolute terms, also has large standard error and cannot be considered statistically significant at the 1% confidence level (i.e. there is a chance >1% that this coefficient is actually 0). 
Third, if your exogenous variables are of different scale it is reasonable to have large discrepancies in absolute terms in the coefficients.
So the answer is that I cannot judge which coefficient is more important at this stage; this would probably require applying a method such forward or backward selection in order to assess the impact of each predictor separately.

ARIMAX vs multiple linear regression: Good enough is relevant. 
There are several ways of evaluating a model's performance. 
Some of them are based on in-sample diagnostics: R2, residual diagnostics and Akaike information criterion among others. 
In fact I believe that auto.arima() uses AIC as a default for model selection. 
If forecasting is your goal, you should probably evaluate based on the forecast accuracy on a hold-out set. 
I would suggest checking the residual diagnostics to get a first assessment of the quality of your model. 
If your residuals are i.i.d. it would indicate a good fit.
